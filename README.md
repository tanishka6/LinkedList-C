# LinkedList-C
ðŸ’» Platform Used: Dev C++
ðŸŽ“ Learning Sources: YouTube, GeeksforGeeks, ChatGPT
ðŸ§¾ Description:
This C program implements a Singly Linked List with fundamental operations such as:

Insertion at the end of the list

Deletion of a node by value

Display of the entire list

The program is menu-driven, allowing users to interactively:

Insert a new node

Delete an existing node by specifying its value

Display the current state of the linked list

Exit the program

Each operation dynamically allocates memory using malloc() and ensures proper memory deallocation with free() during deletion to avoid memory leaks.

The program demonstrates key concepts in Data Structures, including:

Pointer manipulation

Dynamic memory allocation

Node traversal

Conditional logic for node handling (head, middle, or tail)

âœ… Key Concepts Practiced:
Structures (struct) in C

Dynamic memory using malloc() and free()

Pointers and linked list traversal

Menu-driven programming logic

ðŸ§  Learning Outcome:
This project helped reinforce my understanding of dynamic data structures in C, especially how memory is managed in linked lists. It also improved my problem-solving and debugging skills using Dev C++.
